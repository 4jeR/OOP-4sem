# OOP_4sem
Object Oriented Programming in C++ Lab exercises from my 4th semester on AGH University.
Description and documentation had been written in Polish due to the requirements.
Each task given had to be solved within 1h 30min.
If the program didn't compile there were no points at all.
Any kind of support like bringing self notes or Internet research were forbidden.
