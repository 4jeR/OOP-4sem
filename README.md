# OOP_4sem
Object Oriented Programming in C++ Lab exercises from my 4th semester on AGH University 2018/2019.
- description and documentation have been written in Polish due to the requirements,
- each task given (main.cpp and potentially additional files) had to be solved within 1h 30min,
- if the program didn't compile there were no points at all,
- any kind of support like bringing self notes or Internet research were forbidden.
